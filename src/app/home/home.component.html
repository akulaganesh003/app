<h1>Employees' Provident Fund Organisation</h1>
<p>The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is one of the two main statutory social security bodies under the Government of India's Ministry of Labour and Employment and is responsible for regulation and management of provident funds in India, the other being Employees' State Insurance. The EPFO administers the mandatory provident fund. It also manages social security agreements with other countries. International workers are covered under EPFO plans in countries where bilateral agreements have been signed. As of May 2021, 19 such agreements are in place.[1] The EPFO's top decision-making body is the Central Board of Trustees (CBT),[2][3] a statutory body established by the Employees' Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions (EPF&MP) Act, 1952.[4] As of 2018, more than â‚¹11 lakh crore (US$157.8 billion) are under EPFO management.[5]
